# Auto complete system. T9

A small dataset of 50 previous searches is applied. Once you start searching, your request will be recorded in history and ranked based on how many times it has been requested.

Built fully in-memory, using Tries, TrieNode, and Heap (for correct sorting and ranking of each search).

Auto-complete System T9 - Python3, Data Structures (Trie, Heap).
• Designed and developed an efficient in-memory autocomplete system using Trie, TrieNode, and Heap data structures.
• Implemented a scalable and memory-efficient architecture that suggests previous user queries in real-time as they type.
• Built a ranking mechanism based on query frequency, ensuring the most relevant suggestions are prioritized.
• Developed a robust backend API using Flask, providing real-time suggestions without relying on UI-heavy frameworks.
• Integrated previous query history into the system to dynamically update and improve suggestion accuracy with each new search.
